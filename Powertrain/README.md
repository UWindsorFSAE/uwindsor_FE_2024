# University of Windsor Formula Student Electric Powertrain Team

## Repository Overview

This repository contains all of our team's work on:

- **PCB designs**  
- **Wire harnesses**  
- **Motor calculations**  
- **Revisions** of each component

## Repository Structure

### PCB Designs

Contains all PCB designs for the powertrain’s electrical systems, such as:

- Motor controllers  
- Battery Management Systems (BMS)  
- Sensor interfaces  

Each design includes:

- Schematic files  
- Layout files  
- Bill of Materials (BOM)  
- Fabrication outputs (Gerber files, pick-and-place data)

### Wire Harnesses

This section contains wiring diagrams for the vehicle’s electrical systems, including motor and battery connections. Files include:

- Wire gauge and length specifications  
- Connector types  
- Pinouts and routing guidelines  

### Motor Calculations

Stores all powertrain calculations, such as:

- Torque and speed curves  
- Efficiency plots  
- Electrical characteristics (voltage, current, etc.)

### Revisions & Documentation

Contains logs of all component revisions. For each revision:

- **Issue addressed or improvement made**  
- **Test data** validating the changes  
- **Date** and **responsible team member**
